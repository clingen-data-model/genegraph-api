(ns recuration-analysis)

;; Tristan, I thought a bit more about our “analysis over time” conversation on the Gene Curation Small Group call. 
 
;; It looks like most of our curations have “first reported” dates in the 2000s.  There are definitely some earlier than this, but I would argue that these will throw off our analyses because we aren’t really expecting tons of new data to emerge prior to that time just due to limitations in testing capabilities.
 
;; So, if we focused our analyses on only those curations with “first reported” years 2000-2025, I’m envisioning a spreadsheet with  the following:
;; Standard identity fields (gene, disease, MOI)
;; Year of first report (expect 2000 and later)
;; Then, a column for each year 2000-2025 with the number of points documented in the curation in that year.  I’m thinking just total points to make it easier to deal with.
;; Original Total Points
;; Original Classification
;; Original Classification Date
;; Total points, classifications, and dates on any subsequent recurations
 
;; I realize this will make for a sheet with a bunch of 0s (since obviously not every curation will have a start year in 2000), but I think this might be a good way to normalize the information?  So like if a curation was first reported in 2022, it would have 0s in all columns up to 2022, then it would have say 3 points from papers published in 2022, 1 point from papers published in 2023, 3 points from papers published in 2024, etc.
 
;; Does that seem feasible?  We can also discuss further if that doesn’t make sense 😊
